                    You agree that: The Websites shall be deemed solely based in Georgia; and the Websites shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Notum, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Georgia.

You will resolve any claim, cause of action or dispute (claim) you have with us arising out of or relating to the Terms exclusively in the U.S. District Courts for Georgia, or a state court located in Forsyth County, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims.

Notum’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Notum without restriction.
